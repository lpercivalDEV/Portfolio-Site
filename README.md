# Portfolio Site - WIP
This is my portfolio demonstrating sample projects I have worked on. It is not complete as there are many more projects I am in the process of completing/updating/adding to my site. But this simple portfolio should give an overall summary of my skills and experience as a full stack web developer.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

There are quite a few projects included in my portfolio. Many of which highlight my HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6 skill set. I aimed to include both simple static sites as well as applications/sites with a bit more interactivity.

The first simple sites include a web page for Level Ground (a gym/small business) and a sample food blog template.

The more interactive examples include a photography carousel featuring photos from some of my favorite photographers and a simplified slot machine game.


## Lessons Learned:

During the creation of all of these projects, I learned how to implement symantically correct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in accordance with the latest standards and best practices.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have of other projects I've worked on:

# Portfolio Site - WIP
This is my portfolio demonstrating sample projects I have worked on. It is not complete as there are many more projects I am in the process of completing/updating/adding to my site. But this simple portfolio should give an overall summary of my skills and experience as a full stack web developer.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, Express

There are quite a few projects included in my portfolio. Many of which highlight my HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6 skill set. I aimed to include both simple static sites as well as applications/sites with a bit more interactivity.

The first example sites include a simple food blog for showcasing my basic HTML and CSS skills and a site with responsive layouts to show my ability to adapt content for different screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile).

The more interactive examples include a matching card game using node.js which can be run on a local server and a coffee house application with login.


## Lessons Learned:

During the creation of all of these projects, I learned how to implement semantically correct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in accordance with the latest standards and best practices. I also learned how utilize databases, MVC method of organizing documents and code, and login techniques for users.

## Examples:
